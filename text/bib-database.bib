    abstract = {In this paper an attempt is made to explore the logical foundations of computer programming by use of techniques which were first applied in the study of geometry and have later been extended to other branches of mathematics. This involves the elucidation of sets of axioms and rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of computer programs. Examples are given of such axioms and rules, and a formal proof of a simple theorem is displayed. Finally, it is argued that important advantage, both theoretical and practical, may follow from a pursuance of these topics.},

As its name suggests, ACSL is meant to express precisely and unambiguously the expected behavior of a piece of C code. It plays a central role in Frama-C, as nearly all plug-ins eventually manipulate ACSL specifications, either to generate properties that are to be verified, or to assess that the code is conforming to these specifications. It is thus very important to have a clear view of ACSL 's semantics in order to be sure that what you check with Frama-C is really what you mean. This chapter describes the language in an agnostic way, independently of the various verification plug-ins that are implemented in the platform, which are described in more details in other chapters. It contains many examples and exercises that introduce the main features of the language and insists on the most common pitfalls that users, even experienced ones, may encounter.",
